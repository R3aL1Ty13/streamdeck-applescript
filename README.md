# streamdeck-applescript
A Stream Deck plugin for running arbitrary Applescript code

Run any Applescript from your Elgato Stream Deck - allows for either .scpt files or inline applescript code. Note that currently the UI isn't updated to show if a file is being used as the reference, not sure why... Otherwise it should work nicely!
